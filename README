#Loads Clustering
Data science project using this open dataset: http://en.openei.org/datasets/files/961/pub/


The `all_commercial.csv` file already contains a dataset made of the models of every building in the original dataset.

If you want to make your own, download the dataset from the link above, and unzip them. Then use the function `make_buildings_dataset(root, season = "", days = "all")` contained in `tools/make_buildings_dataset.py`.

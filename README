# Loads Clustering
Data science project using this open dataset: http://en.openei.org/datasets/files/961/pub/


The `all_commercial.csv` file already contains a dataset made of the models of every building in the original dataset.

Other csv files have been used for tests.

The clustering and plotting part is done in the iPython Notebook. Pardon me if you'll find it messy, i use it for prototyping and quick tests :)

If you want to make your own dataset, download the dataset from the link above, and unzip them. Then use the function `make_buildings_dataset(root, season = "", days = "all")` contained in `tools/make_buildings_dataset.py`.
